# Introduction to Numbers
# int always rounds down to nearest whole number

# print(float(2))
# print(int(2.0))
# print(int(2.9))

# Math in Python
# a // b - This is Integer Division, where the result will be rounded down so there are no decimal places
# a ** b - This is Exponentiation (a to the power of b)

a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
print(a + b * c ** a)

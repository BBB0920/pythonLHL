# Introduction to Numbers
# int always rounds down to nearest whole number

# print(float(2))
# print(int(2.0))
# print(int(2.9))

# Math in Python
# a // b - This is Integer Division, where the result will be rounded down so there are no decimal places
# a ** b - This is Exponentiation (a to the power of b)

# a = 2
# b = 3
# c = 4
# print(a + b * c ** a)

# Exercise: Tax Calculator

# subtotal = input("What's your subtotal? ")
# taxRate = 0.25
# tax = subtotal * taxRate
# total = subtotal + tax
# print("Your tax is " + str(tax))
# print("Your total is: " + str(total))

# Exercise: Bill Splitter

# bill = input("Bill total: ")
# tip = input("Tip percentage: ")
# people = input("Number of people: ")
# total = round(((bill + float(bill * tip / 100)) / people), 2) 
# print("Each person should pay: $" + str(total))
